fmech/examples - Examples demonstrating the use of fmech for insect
flight simulation.

Files:

example_0.py - simplest example (open loop)

example_1.py - simple example w/ pitch rate based forward velocity 
               controller. Note, roll and yaw only have rate control 
               so eventually the fly will lose flight attitude. 

ctl_examp.py - module containing implementations of various controllers
               including the pitch rate based forward velocity controller
               used in example_1.py


Note, the utility view_sim.py found in /fmech/utils can be used to
render the results of the simulation from the log file as follows 

../utils/view_sim.py log_file

The example utility plot_vals.py found in /fmech/utils plots some of
the data generated during a simulation from the log_file

../util/plot_vals.py log_file
